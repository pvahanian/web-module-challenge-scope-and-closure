 * ### Challenge `processFirstItem`
 * 
 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 * 
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

/* Task 1: `counterMaker`
 * Study the code for counter1 and counter2. Answer the questions below.
 * 
 * 1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
 *  count is delcared within the function "counterMaker" and cant be accessed again.  Counter2
 * its declared outside the function so you can run multiple times and continue to change the value of count.
 * 2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
 * the second one.  reaches outside its scope to find count because it doesn't exist inside of return count.
 * 3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better? 
 *When you dont want the variable to be accessed or modified outside of the function.  When you might need that varible or function again.  Like an on going global count.

/* Task 2: inning() 

Write a function called `inning` that returns a random number of points that a team scored in an inning. This should be a whole number between 0 and 2. */

/* Task 3: finalScore()

Write a higher order function called `finalScore` that accepts the callback function `inning` (from above) and a number of innings and and returns the final score of the game in the form of an object.

For example, 

finalScore(inning, 9) might return:

Create a function called `scoreboard` that accepts the following parameters: 

(1) Callback function `finalScore`
(2) Callback function `inning`
